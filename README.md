# Simple Big Number unsigned arithmetic

This is a C++ (standard) header for unsigned big number arithmetic. It is implemented as a "lifter" from an underlying arithmetic type. For example, lifter<uint64_t> represents a 128-bit unsigned type.

To create a larger type, use the template multiple times. For an example, refer to the .cpp file.
